# FaceTimeHD-dat-files

These files are the FaceTime Sensor Calibration files extracted from the Windows Bootcamp Drivers.  These files should correct the colors of your Apple FaceTime camera on Linux.

The files were extracted using the following instructions:  https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd/wiki/Extracting-the-sensor-calibration-files

Installation:
After you've installed the FaceTime Linux Driver, go to the release page and download each of the DAT files.  Copy these files to facetimehd firmware directory (eg. /lib/firmware/facetimehd/).  You may need to reload the drivers or restart your system.

For installing the FaceTime Linux Driver, I highly recommend going to PatJak's page and following his instructions:  https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd

NOTE:  Use these files at your own risk.  While I make these files available for general use, and I use them myself (and find they help with the color correction), I make no warranty as to their effectiveness.
